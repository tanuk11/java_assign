1) Checked Exception
The classes that directly inherit the Throwable class except 
RuntimeException and Error are known as checked exceptions.
 For example, IOException, SQLException, etc. Checked 
exceptions are checked at compile-time.

2) Unchecked Exception
The classes that inherit the RuntimeException are known as 
unchecked exceptions. For example, ArithmeticException,
 NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, etc. 
Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time, 
but they are checked at runtime.
